        <p class="lead"><strong>Hello Morbo,</strong> how's the family? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind
          me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. I guess
          because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>

        <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>

        <p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots.
          How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.
        Ow, my spirit! Moving along… Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Say what? Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
      Meh. She also liked to shut up! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to
       have her taken away! I'm Santa Claus! You don't know how to do any of those.</p>

        <p class="lead">Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
        <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, <strong>but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</strong> It's toe-tappingly tragic!
          <strong>We're also Santa Claus!</strong> And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one
          day to go. The toilet.</p>
          <p>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Bender, I didn't know
            you liked cooking. That's so cute. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like
            this. But I always really hoped.</p>
